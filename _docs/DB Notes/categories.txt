PERMISSIONS AND MEANING
	Permissions are stored based on their group number. It's a two-deep array. First array has keys of the group ID
that is then used to access to the second array. The second array keys are the permissions which are either a boolean
false or true. Below are the permissions and explanations. Some items pass to boards. If no mention of boards is made,
then they do NOT pass to the boards.

"view" - Whether or not a user can view the category. This passes to child boards too.
