$templates["default"]["config"] = array(
	"name" => "Default Template",
	"development" => false,
	"ic_global" => false
);

$templates["default"] => "default" is the template ID. This is decided by the folder and
	should keep in track with that in order to avoid conflicts. If it isn't correct, the
	ACP just might break... or attempt to auto-correct it. =P
name => Actual name of the template.
development => Boolean of whether or not this template is in development mode. If in 
	development mode, a check should be performed to check and see if the user has 
	permisison to view the template.
ic_global => Boolean of whether or not this template needs to execute the global queries
	for the info center. If this is false, it is only executed in the home.php include. It
	doesn't execute all of the queries, but it runs quite a few of them.
