Brandon *unicef says:
	Oh, I had a cool idea for the forum system.
Brandon *unicef says:
	For modification puroses it'd be very useful.
Brandon *unicef says:
	Okay, you have the normal forums set up
Brandon *unicef says:
	But create a second version only accessible by users that can access the Admin 
	Panel.
Chris says:
	They can do that by just copying and pasting the files. :P
Brandon *unicef says:
	You'd be able to test new skins or modifications in there before it goes fully 
	live.
Brandon *unicef says:
	Yes, but it'd be better if it could be developed on the main site
Chris says:
	I can add an option to only run modules (how code modifications will work) for 
	admins I guess.
Brandon *unicef says:
	Oh, okay, nevermind, that sounds even better.
Chris says:
	There will be a "development" mode option for templates though. Meaning, only if
	you're given access can you access them.
Brandon *unicef says:
	Oh, that sounds cool.


SUMMARY
- Allow plugins to only be run for certain groups (for testing purposes and plugins that only
need to run for admin, etc.)
- "Development Mode" for skins. Only can view them if you're set to be allowed to.
