	The friends list is pretty straight forward. You add users to it and they become 
your "friends." Their names would change color and possibly the background color of their
post too. It'd allow you to recognize them easier in case you're looking for them. (See: 
Watched Users.txt) Also, when composing a PM they'd either be listed automatically on a 
side of the "To" box, or they'd be in a list which you can click. This would allow you to
easily send PMs to people on your friends list. There'd also be a "view friends" page
that is similar to the members list and allows you to view quite a bit of info on your
"friends." The friends list could also aid in making a "MySpace" or "Facebook" like 
system mod. It'd be fun. =D

	The ignore list is also pretty straight forward. (This is less likely to be added
however.) By default, it'd auto-collapse their posts with an option to show it since the 
post may contribute heavily to the thread. Threads by them could also be removed from the
thread listing. There'd also be a global "can't ignore" list so that staff can't be 
ignored.
