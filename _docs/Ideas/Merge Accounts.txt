	As of this time, we're unsure if this will be an admin only option or a user enabled 
option.

	This option allows the merger of two accounts. The merger will select the user data 
(avatar, personal text, msn, yim, aim, etc.) from one account and merge it with another
account. It'll also combine karma (if added), posts, and PMs. However, the "secondary" 
account (which must be designated) will be deleted and only the original will be able to
be used to login. All posts, PMs, etc. will be updated to reflect this change in the 
accounts.
