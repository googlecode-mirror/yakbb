	This allows users in specific usergroups to have a prefix before their name. The
prefix is defined by their usergroup and can be almost anything and it specified via the
admin CP. Some common examples of prefixes are deviantArt's use of *, ^, $, and other
various symbols to represent their members, subscribers, mods, admins, development team, 
etc. It's an effective system and could also be used for something like clans if a system
was needed.

	A suffix system may also be added.
