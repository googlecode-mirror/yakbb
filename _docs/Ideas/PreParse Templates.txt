	The file name is pretty explanatory of the concept. The plan is to give an option 
for an admin to pre-parse all template files to increase loading speed slightly in case
the files are not already parsed. This could save loading times in the future on pages 
that have not yet had a view. This also goes hand in hand with a "Clear Cache" function 
that is planned to be incorporated. This function would probably be located under the 
"Templates" section of the ACP.
