	Language Override allows a template creator to override specific language 
variables or provide unique language variables only needed for that template. The only 
downside to this ability is the fact that it is not section specific (admin panel vs 
viewing boards.) It is a global override and can override many language variables, so 
unique variable names for custom ones are key. There shouldn't be any two identical 
language variable names anyway. If there are, that would be a bug.
