	Official name of the notification/bookmarks feature is "Thread Tracker," or something
similar. This system is similar to PB's, with a few changes.

Here's the basic outline of the features/abilities:
	1. A user may track any thread of any type.
	2. A user may select to be notified of updates via PM, e-mail, or not being updated. 
		SMS is possible if it can be done freely, but that would be an admin option.
	3. A user can select to be notified of new posts, modifications only, new posts and 
		modifications, or no update.

	For number two and three above, "no update" is included so that users can keep track of
a thread for later reference without worrying about receiving random updates. This helps
prevent cluttering of a user's actual bookmarks in their browser.
